# Learning Rust

This is my personal repository where I learn the Rust programming language by solving coding challenges and completing programming exercises. It serves as a collection of my progress, experiments, and solutions as I explore Rust's unique features, such as ownership, lifetimes, and concurrency. A work in progress and a space for hands-on practice!
